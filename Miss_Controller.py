'''
This program operates the MISS's Atik 414EX and Sunshield Lens shutter when the darkness conditions are fullfilled. 

1. Initialise serial communication for SunShield control.
2. Define a function to terminate smoothly (ctrl + C)
3. Check if it is darktime using a specific function.
4. Manage the Atik camera and SunShield based on darktime conditions.
5. Run a loop that checks conditions every 60 seconds and updates the system.
6. Handle interrupts by stopping subprocesses and exiting the script.

Sunshield commands are outcommented since sunshield not installed yet.
