# Software for the Meridian Imaging Svalbard Spectrographs (KHO/UNIS)
This repository will contain all various components and the software for the new Meridian Imaging Svalbard Spectrographs (I and II for now). 
The intention is to gather all necessary tools for the smooth control of the imager from image capture to image processing (RGB composite images, keogram update, spectrogram analysis...)

MISS2 (software/hardware) is directly adapted from [MISS](https://kho.unis.no/Instruments/MISS.html), a spectrograph operational since 2019 at the [Kjell Henriksen Observatory](https://kho.unis.no/), which is operated by the [University Centre In Svalbard](https://www.unis.no/).
